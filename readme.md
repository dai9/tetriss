# Tetris!
A JavaScript implementation of the classic puzzle game, Tetris.

## To Play
tetrisapp.herokuapp.com to play.

## Background
I created Tetris! for my quarter one project after about six weeks of studying JavaScript (and a bit of HTML/CSS). It was initially a purely front-end project that used Firebase to persist high scores across sessions.

Since then, I've learned about servers and databases, so I'm in the processing of transitioning the high scores feature to a Postgres database. After that, I plan to add a two player mode using Socket.io.

## Technologies
- jQuery
- Firebase

## To Do
- Persist scores via Postgres instead of Firebase.
- Add two player mode.
- Make rotating next to walls more friendly.
